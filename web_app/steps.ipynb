    "**1. Project Organization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a project directory for your web application.\n",
    "- Inside this directory, create separate Python files for different functionalities:\n",
    "    - `cleaning.py`: Contains functions for data cleaning.\n",
    "    - `eda.py`: Contains functions for exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "    - `preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for data preprocessing.\n",
    "    - `modeling.py`: Contains functions for model training, evaluation, and potentially explanations (SHAP, PDP, etc.).\n",
    "    - `analysis.py` (optional): Contains functions for further analysis beyond what's done in modeling (e.g., feature importance ranking).\n",
    "    - `app.py`: Contains the Flask application logic, including the main function and function calls for building the web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Structure of `app.py`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a template for your `app.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n",
    "\n",
    "# Import your functions from other files\n",
    "from cleaning import clean_data\n",
    "from eda import perform_eda\n",
    "from preprocessing import preprocess_data\n",
    "from modeling import train_model, explain_with_shap, plot_partial_dependence, analyze_feature_importance\n",
    "from analysis import analyze_further  # (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the Flask app\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the main function (can be empty if not needed)\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "  # Your main execution logic here (if required)\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define routes for your web app functionalities (example)\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "  return render_template(\"index.html\")  # Replace with your template name\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/clean_data\", methods=[\"POST\"])\n",
    "def clean_data_route():\n",
    "  # Get data from request (example)\n",
    "  data = request.form.get(\"data\")\n",
    "  # Clean data using the clean_data function\n",
    "  cleaned_data = clean_data(data)\n",
    "  # Process or return the cleaned data\n",
    "  return \"Cleaned Data: \" + cleaned_data  # Replace with actual processing/response\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add similar routes for other functionalities (EDA, preprocessing, training, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "  main()\n",
    "  app.run(debug=True)  # Set debug=False for production deployment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Calling Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In `app.py`, import the functions you need from other files.\n",
    "- Define routes for different functionalities of your web app (e.g., `/clean_data`, `/train_model`).\n",
    "- Within each route function:\n",
    "  - Handle user input or data requests (if applicable).\n",
    "  - Call the relevant function (e.g., `clean_data`, `train_model`) from the imported modules, passing necessary data.\n",
    "  - Process or return the results from the called function in a user-friendly format (e.g., render HTML templates, display visualizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Flask Deployment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several ways to deploy your Flask application to the web. Here are two common options:\n",
    "    - **Using a Cloud Platform:**  Many cloud platforms like Google Cloud App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Heroku offer easy deployment options for Flask applications.\n",
    "    - **Using a Web Server:** You can set up a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) on your own machine or a virtual server to host your Flask application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organize your HTML templates (`index.html`, etc.) in a separate `templates` folder within your project directory.\n",
    "- Use Flask templating features to dynamically render HTML pages based on data or functionalities.\n",
    "- For deployment, ensure your environment (Python version, libraries) on the deployment server matches your development environment to avoid compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structure and organization, you can create a well-structured and maintainable Flask application with interactive data cleaning, EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and analysis capabilities."
