    "All the functions you provided seem well-structured and handle user interaction effectively. Here's a breakdown of potential improvements and minor issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "**`handle_missing_values`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minor Enhancement:** In the imputation section, you could consider adding a choice for handling missing categorical data using the mode (most frequent category). Currently, the imputation methods focus on numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`identify_and_handle_outliers`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loop for Imputation Method:** The current implementation prompts the user for an imputation method within a loop. An alternative approach would be to define the imputation logic outside the loop and conditionally call it based on user input (e.g., using an if-elif structure). This might improve readability.\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** While the code checks for a valid imputation method choice, it wouldn't handle potential errors during the imputation itself (e.g., if the chosen method isn't suitable for the data type). Consider adding checks or exception handling to make the function more robust. \n",
    "- **Consider Winsorization:**  In addition to imputation and removal, you might want to explore the option of winsorizing outliers (capping them to a certain percentile) as another potential outlier treatment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`handle_duplicates`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minor Enhancement:** In the option to view all duplicates, you could limit the number of rows displayed (e.g., using `.head(10)`) to avoid overwhelming the user with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`handle_formatting`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formatting Choice Expansion:**  In the date format selection, you could consider including more common formats besides the ones provided (e.g., \"%d-%b-%Y\" for DD-Mon-YYYY).\n",
    "- **Currency Formatting Enhancement:** The current approach assumes text data for currency columns. If you expect numeric data with currency symbols, you might need to convert them to numeric before removing symbols or applying a chosen symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just some suggestions for improvement. The overall structure of your functions is good, and they provide clear explanations and user interactions for data cleaning tasks."
