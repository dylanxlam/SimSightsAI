    "**1. Project Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new directory for SimSightsAI\n",
    "* Inside my project directory, create subdirectories for different functionalities (optional but recommended for organization):\n",
    "    * data_handler/ (for data loading and cleaning functions)\n",
    "    * visualization/ (for visualization functions)\n",
    "    * modeling/ (for machine learning functions)\n",
    "    * explanations/ (optional, for explainer functions)\n",

    "**2. Initial Flask Application (app.py):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a file named `app.py` in my project directory.\n",
    "* This file will serve as the entry point for my Flask application. Here's a basic structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, render_template, request\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return render_template(\"index.html\")  # Replace with actual content or logic\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Simple User Interface (Optional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a basic HTML file named `index.html` in my project directory (content will be replaced later).\n",
    "* This file can initially display instructions for users on how to upload data and interact with the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Running the Application:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to my project directory.\n",
    "* Run Flask application using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This will start the development server, and I can usually access my application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in my web browser. I'll see a basic page based on my `index.html` content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps can involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implementing the `data_handler.py` functions to handle data upload, cleaning, and pre-processing (start with basic cleaning).\n",
    "* Developing the `visualization.py` functions to generate histograms and scatterplots for data exploration.\n",
    "* Defining routes in `app.py` to handle data upload and visualization selection.\n",
    "* Testing my functionalities step-by-step to ensure they work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, this is an iterative process. Start with the core functionalities, test them thoroughly, and gradually add more complexity based on my plan. \n"
