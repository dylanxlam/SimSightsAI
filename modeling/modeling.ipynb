    "3. **Hyperparameter Grid:** Utilizes the provided hyperparameter grid as a search space for tuning.\n",
    "4. **GridSearchCV Integration:** Employs GridSearchCV from scikit-learn (or a similar library function) to perform the tuning process. This involves:\n",
    "   - Creating a GridSearchCV object with the model class, hyperparameter grid, cross-validation folds (cv), and a scoring metric (replace `\"accuracy\"` with the appropriate metric for your task).\n",
    "   - Training the model with various hyperparameter combinations using the training data.\n",

    "5. **Best Model Selection:** Identifies the model with the best performance based on the chosen scoring metric.\n",
    "6. **Return Best Model:** Returns the best model found during the tuning process, allowing it to be used for further training or evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-friendly:** Provides clear explanations and interacts with the user regarding the tuning process.\n",
    "- **Informative:** Displays the chosen model class and the best model found after tuning.\n",
    "- **GridSearchCV Integration:** Leverages a widely used technique (or similar function from other libraries) for efficient hyperparameter exploration.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Works with user-provided hyperparameter grids, allowing customization of the search space.\n",

    "The integration between the `train_model` and `tune_hyperparameters` functions allows users to leverage hyperparameter tuning within the training process. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choice for Tuning:** Within `train_model`, the function checks if `hyperparameter_options` are provided. If yes, it presents the user with the option to explore hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "2. **User Input:** The user chooses \"y\" or \"n\" to indicate whether they want to explore tuning.\n",
    "3. **Tuning Activation (if chosen):**\n",
    "   - If the user chooses \"y\", the `tune_hyperparameters` function is called.\n",
    "   - This function takes the following arguments:\n",
    "     - `chosen_model.__class__`: This passes the class of the chosen model (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`) for creating a new instance during tuning.\n",
    "     - `train_data`: The training data used for fitting the model during tuning.\n",
    "     - `val_data`: The validation data used for evaluating model performance during tuning.\n",
    "     - `hyperparameter_options`:  The dictionary containing the hyperparameter grid for tuning.\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**\n",
    "   - The `tune_hyperparameters` function utilizes GridSearchCV (or a similar library function) to explore different hyperparameter combinations from the provided grid.\n",
    "   - It trains the model with these combinations on the training data and evaluates their performance on the validation data.\n",
    "5. **Best Model Selection:**\n",
    "   - The function identifies the model with the best performance based on the chosen scoring metric (e.g., accuracy).\n",
    "   - It then returns this \"best model\" found during tuning.\n",
    "6. **Model Update (if tuning was chosen):**\n",
    "   - Back in `train_model`, the function receives the returned \"best model\" from `tune_hyperparameters` and assigns it to the `tuned_model` variable.\n",
    "   - Crucially, it updates the original `chosen_model` variable with the `tuned_model`. This ensures the subsequent training process utilizes the hyperparameter-tuned model for better performance (potentially).\n",
    "7. **Training the Model:**\n",
    "   - Regardless of whether tuning was performed, `train_model` proceeds by using the `chosen_model` (which might be the original or the tuned model) to fit the training data. \n",
    "   - It separates features and target before fitting the model.\n",
    "8. **Model Evaluation (Basic) and Return:**\n",
    "   - The function performs basic model evaluation on the validation data (implementation details not included in this example).\n",
    "   - Finally, it returns the trained model, which could be the original model or the tuned model depending on the user's choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Integration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-friendly:** The `train_model` function guides the user through the process with clear explanations and interactive options.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Users can choose whether to explore hyperparameter tuning based on their needs.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** If tuning is chosen, the `tune_hyperparameters` function efficiently explores various hyperparameter combinations using GridSearchCV.\n",
    "- **Performance Improvement (Potential):** By using the tuned model for training, there's a chance of achieving better performance compared to using the default hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this integration offers users a convenient way to explore hyperparameter tuning within the training process, potentially leading to improved model performance. It provides a balance between user-friendliness and the possibility of performance gains through tuning."
